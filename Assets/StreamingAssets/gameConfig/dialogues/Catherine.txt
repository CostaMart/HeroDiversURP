Careful, darling... these sands hide more than secrets. A storm could sweep you away if you're not careful. \n I might just have exactly what you need... to survive the dunes of Kaladian.
Mmm, you look... overheated, sweetheart. Out here, even steel melts under this sun. Maybe I could sell you something to help you live a little longer... or at least long enough to come back to buy more.
That cooling system of yours is making such a charming little noise... outdated, though. Lucky for you, I have just the thing to keep you from roasting alive.
Oh no, sugar... this storm could strip you bare faster than I could strip you of your credits. You’ll need something to shield you... and, wouldn’t you know it, I’m the only one selling it.
It’s hard to resist my charms... but resisting the sun is even harder. If I were you, I’d pick the battle I can actually win.
Oh, darling... survival has its price, and you... seem a little short on the important stuff. Come back when you’ve got more to offer me.
Oh my... you look crispy, sweetheart. Maybe you should've invested in me a little sooner.
Mmm, you’re cutting it close, darling. When night falls on Caladian... it devours you whole. Maybe you should stock up before the beasts come out to play.
he heat may leave when the sun does, sugar... but the real nightmares wake up icy and hungry. Better make sure you're ready.
I’d hate to see that pretty face of yours get torn apart under the stars. Grab what you need... before the dark does.
You’ve got more eyes on you than a starship launch, darling. Aliens, drones, beasts...Everyone’s hungry for a piece of you. Me? I just want your credits.
